*The .findById() method is commonly used in MongoDB with Mongoose, a popular ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. 
It is used to find a single document in a collection based on its _id (ObjectId)
*const userId = 'someId'; // Replace with the actual ObjectId
const user = await User.findById(userId);
In this example, User is the Mongoose model, and userId is the specific _id you want to search for. The await keyword is used because the operation is asynchronous.
This method is a convenient way to retrieve a single document by its unique identifier. Keep in mind that if the document with the specified _id is not found, the result will be null.
async function postData(url = "", data = {}) {
  // Default options are marked with *
  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: "POST", // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      
    },
   
    body: JSON.stringify(data), 
  });
  return response.json(); 
}
